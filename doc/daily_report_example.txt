### *Revenge of the Sith* ###

Red Five standing by. I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me. I'm trying not to, kid. Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense. Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Imperial Star Destroyer ###

Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone. What?! He is here.

* Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.
* He is here.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### The Clone Wars ###

Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away! The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers. Red Five standing by. Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. I call it luck.
